#Space Cadets Week 4#

###Challenge###
To create a Bare Bones interpreter. Bare Bones is a very simple language used by Brookshere in his book [Computer Science: an Overview](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Computer-Science-Overview-Glenn-Brookshear/dp/0321544285/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225741559&sr=8-1). I have used the documentation [here](https://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/software/barebones/bare_bones_language_summary.html), to create my interpreter.

###Running###
* To run this program, compile all the classes, then call Program. 
	e.g. 	`java Program`

* You can use command line arguments to specify variables.
	e.g 	`java Program X=12 Y=7`

###Note###
1. The program currently does not work for nested while loops.
