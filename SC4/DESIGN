clear <var>;	Set the variable to zero.
incr <var>;	    Increment the value of the variable.
decr <var>;	    Decrement the value of the variable, except that if the value was already zero, it remains zero.
while <var> not 0 do; 
<statements> 
end;	               Loop while the variable's value is not zero. May contain one or more statements, including nested while loops. If the statements do not alter the value of the loop variable, the loop will never terminate.
copy <var> to <var>;	   Copy one variable to another, preserving value of original.
init <var> = <int>;     initialize variable

class Program
	contains main variables
	loads the file
	uses other classes to run the file

class Variable
	makes new HashMaps to contain variables.
	can do without, but I was getting a bit lost in the code.
	
class Instruction extends Statement
	contains methods for:
	init, inc, decr, clear, copy

class While
	implements while loop recursively
	feeds statements of loop back into Program.

class Statement
	some basic HashMap methods.
	possibly unused atm.
