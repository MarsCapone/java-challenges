Have a look at the Web page at http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/dem. This is a departmental information page which gives all sorts of information about a student or member of staff. 
The Web address is constructed from a departmental email id (in this case dem). If I have someone else's email id, I can look up their name from one of these Web pages. 
Try it with your own email id. In fact, the name used to start at the 12th character of the 6th line of the HTML data returned by the Web server. It finishes when a '<' character appears. 
(Choose 'View Source' from your Web browser to check where it is now.)

Write a program which converts an email id into a name by:
	Constructing a BufferedReader object so that can read an email id from System.in (you will need some intermediate objects to help you here. Look it up!)
	Constructing the full Web page address by string concatenation
	Constructing a URL object from the Web address
	Constructing a BufferedReader object that can read from the URL (you will need some intermediate objects to help you here. Look in the book!)
	Ignoring the first lines of input from the Web page and saving the one which contains the name (Hint: class="vcard" - Toby Hunt (Systems staff))
	Use the substring() method to make a temporary string which starts at the appropriate character (remember that substring numbers from 0)
	Use the indexOf() method to find where the '<' character appears in that string
	Use the substring() method again to select the 0th character through to the end of the name
	Print out the result

This sounds quite complex, but it is just a longer variation on the things you will already have seen in the book and in your labs. It's actually quite simple, but as in all programming, the devil is in the details!
